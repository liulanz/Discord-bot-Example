# Discord-bot-Example

This program is written based on YouTube video [**Code a Discord Bot with Python - Host for Free in the Cloud**](https://youtu.be/SPTfmiYiuok)

It uses [**repl.it**](https://repl.it/@LiuLanLan/Discord-Bot#main.py), **repl.it database**, **discord library**, [**Random Quotes API**](https://zenquotes.io/) to create a Discord Bot that sends back encouraging messages based on user request. 

It uses **Flask** to create a web server and [**Uptime Robot**](https://uptimerobot.com/) to ping the server every 5 mins, so the bot can be run continuously.


Bot token needs to be added in .env
